# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, August 7, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Learned of DailyUI challenge and recreated a landing page.

**Thoughts:** More of a warm up day, to test the 1-hour timeslot. Spent too much time looking for an idea. Hoping the daily 1-hour routine will help me be less 'precious' with my choices.

### Day 2: Wednesday, August 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read the d3 intro docs and tried some basics.

**Thoughts:** Lot's of potential with this library for data visualization. Need to brainstorm ideas for projects to try.

### Day 3: Thursday, August 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Very long work day, made a CSS Tweety bird.

**Thoughts:** Not actually finished, but spent an hour and can barely keep my eyes open. The intention of the challenge is (likely) to work in a more engaged manner, but... life.

### Day 4: Friday, August 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created D3 chart with transitions.

**Thoughts:** These are fun.

### Day 5: Saturday, August 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Not a lot of progress, as I kept switching between topics. D3 to svg to atomic react to machine learning in one hour.

**Thoughts:** Need to focus on one task per day. I eventually added css variable updating to an old pen to have some code to link.

### Day 6: Sunday, August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued brick background from Day 5.

**Thoughts:** Did not have as much availabiltiy today as hoped. Continued on previous pen, adding random color changing. Almost finished random positioning, but missing something. TBC

### Day 7: Monday, August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started by working on the previous pen, only to realize what I was trying to do was not supported spec. Switched to GSAP.

**Thoughts:** This will be a lot of fun when I have an idea ready for the developing.

### Day 8: Tuesday, August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started on a fitness app, using react.

**Thoughts:** Have been brainstorming parts of this for the last few days. Haven't used react before so this should be fun.

### Day 9: Wednesday, August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: A non-progress day.

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time switching between ideas, or researching what I'd like to do. No final product worth linking to, and I'm not sure if this counts as a 'completed day' at all. I should probably brainstorm a list of 1-hour projects for future days like this.
The fitness app I started yesterday needs a lot more planning, or perhaps 1-hour react tutorial followed by 1-hour coding.
Looking forward to the weekend to have a larger chunk of free time available for planning the remainder of the challenge.
Note to self: Sprucing up previous pens/projects is another option when out of ideas.

### Day 10: Thursday, August 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on many different ideas, then realized I needed something 'finished' to link to so I made another Daily UI.

**Thoughts:** Need a battleplan.

### Day 11: Sunday, August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a React To Do app.

**Thoughts:** Last couple days I was researching/playing, but end of the day didn't have a final product to commit or link. Added a new repo called 'todo', to potentially add To Do apps from any future library/framework/language I may like to test.

### Day 12: Tuesday, August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a Vue To Do app.

**Thoughts:** Not sure if I have a preference between React or Vue.

### Day 13: Wednesday, August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: *Tried* to create an Angular To Do app. Spent twice as long as both Vue and React To Dos, and still not working.

**Thoughts:** Not sure if I have a preference between React or Vue, but currently prefer both to Angular.
