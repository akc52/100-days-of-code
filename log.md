# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, August 7, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Learned of DailyUI challenge and recreated a landing page.

**Thoughts:** More of a warm up day, to test the 1-hour timeslot. Spent too much time looking for an idea. Hoping the daily 1-hour routine will help me be less 'precious' with my choices.

### Day 2: Wednesday, August 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read the d3 intro docs and tried some basics.

**Thoughts:** Lot's of potential with this library for data visualization. Need to brainstorm ideas for projects to try.

### Day 3: Thursday, August 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Very long work day, made a CSS Tweety bird.

**Thoughts:** Not actually finished, but spent an hour and can barely keep my eyes open. The intention of the challenge is (likely) to work in a more engaged manner, but... life.

**Link to work:** [Tweety](https://codepen.io/akc52/pen/77a00bf3afbe0715eb5374363de749b0/)

### Day 4: Friday, August 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created D3 chart with transitions.

**Thoughts:** These are fun.

**Link to work:** [Hours of Sleep in the last two weeks - d3 test](https://codepen.io/akc52/pen/xJMEBq)

### Day 5: Saturday, August 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Not a lot of progress, as I kept switching between topics. D3 to svg to atomic react to machine learning in one hour.

**Thoughts:** Need to focus on one task per day. I eventually added css variable updating to an old pen to have some code to link.

### Day 6: Sunday, August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued brick background from Day 5.

**Thoughts:** Did not have as much availabiltiy today as hoped. Continued on previous pen, adding random color changing. Almost finished random positioning, but missing something. TBC

### Day 7: Monday, August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started by working on the previous pen, only to realize what I was trying to do was not supported spec. Switched to GSAP.

**Thoughts:** This will be a lot of fun when I have an idea ready for the developing.

**Link to work:** [GSAP SplitText test](https://codepen.io/akc52/pen/78c0d7edd92c4caf771fa2d51435905e)

### Day 8: Tuesday, August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started on a fitness app, using react.

**Thoughts:** Have been brainstorming parts of this for the last few days. Haven't used react before so this should be fun.

**Link to work:** [FitnessApp](https://github.com/akc52/FitnessApp)

### Day 9: Wednesday, August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: A non-progress day.

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time switching between ideas, or researching what I'd like to do. No final product worth linking to, and I'm not sure if this counts as a 'completed day' at all. I should probably brainstorm a list of 1-hour projects for future days like this.
The fitness app I started yesterday needs a lot more planning, or perhaps 1-hour react tutorial followed by 1-hour coding.
Looking forward to the weekend to have a larger chunk of free time available for planning the remainder of the challenge.
Note to self: Sprucing up previous pens/projects is another option when out of ideas.

### Day 10: Thursday, August 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on many different ideas, then realized I needed something 'finished' to link to so I made another Daily UI.

**Thoughts:** Need a battleplan.

### Day 11: Sunday, August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a React To Do app.

**Thoughts:** Last couple days I was researching/playing, but end of the day didn't have a final product to commit or link. Added a new repo called 'todo', to potentially add To Do apps from any future library/framework/language I may like to test.

**Link to work:** [React To Do app](https://github.com/akc52/todo/tree/master/react-todo)

### Day 12: Tuesday, August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a Vue To Do app.

**Thoughts:** Not sure if I have a preference between React or Vue.

**Link to work:** [Vue To Do app](https://github.com/akc52/todo/tree/master/vue-todo)

### Day 13: Wednesday, August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: *Tried* to create an Angular To Do app. Spent twice as long as both Vue and React To Dos, and still not working.

**Thoughts:** Not sure if I have a preference between React or Vue, but currently prefer both to Angular.

**Link to work:** [Angular To Do app](https://github.com/akc52/todo/tree/master/angular-todo)

### Day 14: Tuesday, August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made a pretty thing with p5js.

**Thoughts:** Another library that would be fun to play with.

**Link to work:** [Triangle wormhole drawer (with p5js)](https://codepen.io/akc52/pen/VGjGXJ)

### Day 15: Monday, September 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Another varied day. Created a repo to hold the algorithums and such that I've been trying.

**Thoughts:** Did a lot of brushing up. Better handle on flexbox/css grid.

**Link to work:** [Alogrithums and Such](https://github.com/akc52/algos)

### Day 16: Wednesday, September 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Another varied day. Created a bouncing ball animation using GSAP.

**Link to work:**

- [iOS Interactive Story App tutorial](https://github.com/akc52/InteractiveStory)

### Day 17: Thursday, September 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Following a pluralsight React tutorial. A few new concepts, and it seems a large portion of the tutorial is Redux. Reviewing old notes.

### Day 18: Saturday, September 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Nearly completed freeCodeCamp's React tutorial.

**Thoughts:** I thought this challenge required creating custom code each day, so you could link to your work. I felt really guilty on days when I reviewed tutorials but didn't write something new, and I wouldn't count it toward the 100. That ruined the momentum and made it harder to stick to the routine.

However, Twitter seems to be full of folks who frequently 'finish a video tutorial' but don't create anything, so I'm probably too hard on myself. It's my own fault for not tweeting more frequently and realizing this sooner...

Regarding the React tutorial, it was great review and helped contextualize a lot of what I've learned. I'm surprised by the bredth of topics fcc covers. (I had always assumed it was solely HTML/CSS). I look forward to using this resource again, especially with Redux, D3 (the entire Data Visualization Section), Node, and algorithums practice.

### Day 19: Sunday, September 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's React Challenge.

**Thoughts:** It was nice to complete a checklist. Next, I need a project idea to tackle and work on for a few days.

**Link to work: ** [freeCodeCamp Profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/akc52)

### Day 20: Monday, September 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished on FCC - Accessibility, Flexbox, some ES6. Continued with PS "Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6".

**Thoughts:** Not getting redux (specifically reducers). I should focus on it tomorrow, rather than touch on at the end of the day.

**Link to work:** [freeCodeCamp Profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/akc52)

### Day 21: Tuesday, September 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working through some ES6 problems on fcc. Also, *won tickets to Web Unleashed 2018!!*

**Thoughts:** I'll need to do a lot more practice with ES6.

Also, in regards to winning tickets, you really never know what will happen until you try!

**Link to work:** [freeCodeCamp Profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/akc52)

### Day 22: Wednesday, September 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed freeCodeCamp modules *Data Visualization with D3* and *JSON APIs and Ajax*. Going to work on the Data Visualization projects to complete the certificate, because why not.

**Thoughts:** A couple hours with fcc's *Data Visualization with D3* helped me more than a week of learning D3 on my own, heh. I'm flying through these, while also aware I can't rely on fcc entirely -- but it's a great starting point. A couple of the projects may be nice additions to a portfolio.

### Day 23: Thursday, September 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on d3 barchart project.

**Thoughts:** Got a bit stuck after adding live data to the pen. Need to start work soon, so will commit as in progress.

### Day 24: Friday, September 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed strange 'mocha not loaded' error with D3 project. The testing library had to be loaded last. Cool.

**Thoughts:** That was frustrating. Lost a couple days undoing/redoing work.

**Link to work:** [barchart](https://github.com/akc52/data-visualization/barchart/)

### Day 25: Sunday, September 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to make headway in my D3 barchart project, but lost a ton of time trying to rearrange the file structure and implement webpack. Got repeated 'mocha not loaded' errors.

**Thoughts:** I thought I solved the mochas not loaded errors by rearranging the script load order, but it's apparently a bigger issue. Spent some time trying to find alternate solutions, with nothing yet.

**Link to work:** [barchart](https://github.com/akc52/data-visualization/barchart/)

### Day 26: Monday, September 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Same errors in Barchart project. I think they're related to environment set up. Alternative would be to use codepen exclusively, but I'd like to use version control for these projects.

**Thoughts:** Might need to start from scratch. In the end, practiced algorithms on fcc.

**Link to work:** [freeCodeCamp Profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/akc52)

### Day 27: Tuesday, September 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished a random quote generator (sans styling), using React.

**Thoughts:** Feeling quite accomplished. The thing is very simple (and currently looks hideous) but the functionality is there and it was created without a tutorial.

**Link to work:** [Random Quote Generator](https://github.com/akc52/randomquotegenerator)

### Day 28: Wednesday, September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a 'stand in' portfolio landing page. Super basic, but functional.

Also renamed a few git repos, for uniformity's sake. I won't change the links here until I'm sure they'll stay as is.

**Thoughts:** I have a problem with requiring perfection over progress... I've been over-thinking what needs to go on a portfolio page, and it only resulted in stress and no portfolio. This *super* basic version (essentially a collection of links) is good enough for now.

### Day 29: Friday, September 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished multiple algorithum challenges on fcc.
