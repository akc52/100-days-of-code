# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, August 7, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Learned of DailyUI challenge and recreated a landing page.

**Thoughts:** More of a warm up day, to test the 1-hour timeslot. Spent too much time looking for an idea. Hoping the daily 1-hour routine will help me be less 'precious' with my choices.

### Day 2: Wednesday, August 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read the d3 intro docs and tried some basics.

**Thoughts:** Lot's of potential with this library for data visualization. Need to brainstorm ideas for projects to try.

### Day 3: Thursday, August 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Very long work day, made a CSS Tweety bird.

**Thoughts:** Not actually finished, but spent an hour and can barely keep my eyes open. The intention of the challenge is (likely) to work in a more engaged manner, but... life.

### Day 4: Friday, August 10, 2018

**Thoughts:** These are fun.

### Day 5: Saturday, August 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Not a lot of progress, as I kept switching between topics. D3 to svg to atomic react to machine learning in one hour.

**Thoughts:** Need to focus on one task per day. I eventually added css variable updating to an old pen to have some code to link.

### Day 6: Sunday, August 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Continued brick background from Day 5.

**Thoughts:** Did not have as much availabiltiy today as hoped. Continued on previous pen, adding random color changing. Almost finished random positioning, but missing something. TBC

### Day 7: Monday, August 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started by working on the previous pen, only to realize what I was trying to do was not supported spec. Switched to GSAP.

**Thoughts:** This will be a lot of fun when I have an idea ready for the developing.
