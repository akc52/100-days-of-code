# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, August 7, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Learned of DailyUI challenge and recreated a landing page.

**Thoughts:** More of a warm up day, to test the 1-hour timeslot. Spent too much time looking for an idea. Hoping the daily 1-hour routine will help me be less 'precious' with my choices.

### Day 2: Wednesday, August 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read the d3 intro docs and tried some basics.

**Thoughts:** Lot's of potential with this library for data visualization. Need to brainstorm ideas for projects to try.

### Day 3: Thursday, August 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Very long work day, made a CSS Tweety bird.

**Thoughts:** Not actually finished, but spent an hour and can barely keep my eyes open. The intention of the challenge is (likely) to work in a more engaged manner, but... life.
